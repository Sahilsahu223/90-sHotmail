    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Hi, I’m Sahil! <br>
        This is a simple yet exciting project built using HTML and CSS. <br> I’ve aimed to recreate the look and feel of Hotmail’s 1998 interface as a tribute to its classic design. <br>This project marks my first step into the world of Hackathons, and I’m thrilled to showcase my work!</p>
